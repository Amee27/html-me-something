      <h3>Beautiful Rainbow</h3>
      <p>A <em>rainbow</em> is an arc of color in the sky that
        can be seen<br> when the sun shines through 
        falling rain. A <em>rainbow</em> is <br>created
        white light is bent(refracted) while 
        a droplet of<br> water, split into separate
        colours, and reflected back.<br> A <em>rainbow</em>
        is actually round like a circle.</p>
      <p>A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused<br> by reflection, refraction and dispersion of light in water<br>
         droplets resulting in a spectrum of light.</p>
      <p> Rainbows, light, color, music, these are the things that break<br> through to our dark places and lift us up. They make small spaces<br> of lightness in a heavy heart, spaces for hope to take root. ...So the<br> rainbows were right to pursue me, their message is an important<br
        > one. Beauty matters, especially in times of pain.</p>
