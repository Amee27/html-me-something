                    <h3>Beautiful Rainbow</h3>
                    <p>A <em>rainbow</em> is an arc of color in the sky that can be seen when the sun 
                        shines throughfalling rain. A <em>rainbow</em> is created white light is 
                        bent(refracted) while a droplet of water, split into separate colours, 
                        and reflected back. A <em>rainbow</em> is actually round like a circle.
                    </p>
                    <p>A rainbow is a meteorological phenomenon that is caused by reflection, refraction 
                        and dispersion of light in water droplets resulting in a spectrum of light.
                    </p>
                    <p> Rainbows, light, color, music, these are the things that break through to our 
                        dark places and lift us up. They make small spaces of lightness in a heavy heart, 
                        spaces for hope to take root. ...So the rainbows were right to pursue me, 
                        their message is an important one. Beauty matters, especially in times of pain.
